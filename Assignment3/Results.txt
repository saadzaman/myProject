For a very large number of small files 
time taken in my pc as shown in figure 1 was 0.14 in serial
and 

for same number of files time taken was 0.031 in parallel

speedup for Matching = 0.14/0.031 = 4.5times

but speed for hashing was decreased in parallel :S
speed in parallel = 0.031
speed in serial = 0.016
A Decrease of 0.5 times in speed while hashing


*All these results have been obtained by using a simple generic data set of small files
