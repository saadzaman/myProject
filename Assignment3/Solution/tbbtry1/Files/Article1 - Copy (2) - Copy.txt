Jannah

“As to those who believe and work righteous deeds, they have the Gardens of Paradise (Firdaws) as their abode.” (Al-Kahf, 18:107)

Protection from Fire

Anas ibn Maalik (ra) narrates that the Prophet (saw) said, “Whoever says Laa ilaaha illAllah while having a grain’s worth of goodness (or faith) in his heart shall be taken out of the Hellfire….” (Al-Bukhari 13/394 and Muslim 3/59)

Abu Sa’eed AlKhudree said that the Prophet (saw) said that the people of Jannah will enter Jannah and the people of Hellfire will enter the Hellfire. Then Allah (SWT) will say: Come out, whoever among you has a mustard seed’s weight of faith…..” (Bukhari- See Al-Fath 1/72 and Muslim- See An-Nawawi 3/36)

A Bedouin came to the Prophet (saw) and said, “Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it.” The Prophet (saw) said, “Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan.” The Bedouin said, “By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this.” When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, “Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man.” (Bukhari)

Key to Having other Deeds Accepted

“And whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it as he ought to strive and he is a believer; (as for) these, their striving shall surely be accepted.” (Al-Israa’, 17:19)



Means of Forgiveness for Sins

“Except those who repent, and believe and do righteous deeds, for as to these, Allah will convert their evil deeds into good ones, and Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful.” (Al-Furqaan, 25:70)

Achieving the Protection of Allah.

“Verily, Allah’s awliyaa’ have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.” (Younus, 10: 62)
