Purpose of Creation

“I did not create the jinns and the humans except to worship Me alone.” (Adh-Dhaariyaat, 51:56) 

This is the most explicit verse in the Quran about the purpose of our creation.

Reason for Sending Prophets

“And We sent no Messenger before you but We revealed to him: There is no true god but I; so worship Me alone.” (Al-Anbiyaa’, 21:25)
